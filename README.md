## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS BEM



### What I learned

I learned how to style the list marker and finely control the gap after the List Marker using:
 - list-style-position: inside
 - list-style-type: "âœ“";
 - ::marker pseudo-element
 - ::before pseudo-element
 - content: counter(list-item)".";

I matched the Figma design below, I adjusted the gap after the list Marker and its size and I centered the list marker against the line break, positioning it midway between the line 'Total: Approximately 10' and minutes.

But I sacrifice the accessibility for screen reader on the list. 



### Continued development

- Improve the accessibility for screen reader on the list while keeping the Figma design on teh list marker.
